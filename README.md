# Where's CarveHouse now??
I learned about woodworking and building teardrop trailers from Roger Juno. I helped him build one of his teardrop trailers in exchange for getting to be an apprentice. He also let me use his shop and tools a couple times which was extremely helpful, especially for routing the walls and building the curved hatch frame. 

The original idea for the trailer was that after graduating college, I would live in it while travelling the country. But instead, I joined Teach For America, and I gave the trailer to Roger Juno. I don't know what happened after that, but I assume Roger put aluminum walls on it and found a buyer. I hope someone has been using it for their own adventures! 

Also - Collier, Paul, Dave, and Michael were great help and fun to work with during the build.
